This is a fork of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1494

The script is essentially the same, except that it allows nested folds and it does not map the E key or the gd key combination.

Folding goes like this:

1. Both class or function definitions are folded with a maximum nesting level of 10.
2. Folding is done one line after the class or function definition, so
    for example the line 'class foo( bar )' is right above the fold
3. Fold text is the first line of the corresponding docstring (if any)
    together with the number of folded lines
4. Toggle all folds on/off with the key F
5. Toggle the fold under the cursor on/off with the key f
6. In some rare cases folding can break down which can be fixed by :call ReFold()
    The reason for this break down is not known sometimes it happens when jumping
    between different files using tags.

Inspired by vimscript #515, actually the way the number of lines are displayed is stolen from there :). A related script is vimscript #781 and a tip on toggling a fold is vimtip #108.
